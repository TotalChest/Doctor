# Doctor
Functional programming practice (Scheme)


## Description
ELIZA (Doctor) is a classic example of the use of Lisp in a sample artificial intelligence (AI) application. Originally written by Joseph Weizenbaum, ELIZA is a program that "simulates" a patient's discussion with a psychiatrist. While appearing on the surface to possess "intelligence", the program is actually little more than a simple pattern matcher. A sample dialogue with ELIZA follows (user input is in lower case, with ELIZA's responses in upper case):

\- **MAY I HELP YOU?**  
\- i want you to help me  
\- **WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT ME TO HELP YOU?**  
\- im afraid to tell you  
\- **YOURE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT ME, ARE YOU?**  
\- what does that mean  
\- **WHY DO YOU ASK?**  
\- are you asking me  
\- **WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN WHETHER OR NOT I AM ASKING YOU?**  
\- why do you keep answering with questions  
\- **DOES THAT QUESTION INTEREST YOU?**  
\- i dont know  
\- **DONT YOU REALLY KNOW?**  
\- no  
\- **ARE YOU SAYING NO JUST TO BE NEGATIVE?**  
\- i think so  
\- **DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?**  
\- not always  
\- **CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?**  
\- oh shut up  
\- **IM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU FULLY?**  
\- goodbye  
\- **GOODBYE**
